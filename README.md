What did i learn about algorithms?
I learned that with respect to cubes, that there is a finite method to solving a variety of cases.

How do i know it was analgorithm?
I know its an algorithm because with 2x2 cubes theres only a certain number of different configurations the cube can pertain to and using various calculated movements in order to manipulate the colored sides in order to solve all 6 sides.

What is an algorithm to me?
an algorithm to me is a function or pattern that can be used to describe or solve for certain values or variations of some variety.
